### Hi there 👋 I'm Saverio!


I'm a software developer from Italy 🇮🇹 with a heavy focus on data. Some say I should be defined as a "data engineer"!.  

I currently work at [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/) 🇳🇱  
I'm dedicating my time to a climate science project, involving SQL and NoSQL databases, Docker, Kubernetes, real-time data streaming platforms and ETL tools.


I've opened this GitHub account **{{ ACCOUNT_AGE }}** years ago.  
Since then, I've pushed **{{ COMMITS }}** commits, opened **{{ ISSUES }}** issues, submitted **{{ PULL_REQUESTS }}** pull requests and reviewed **{{ CODE_REVIEWS }}** of them!  
So far I've received **{{ STARS }}** stars ⭐.

I ❤️ open source. In fact, I've been contributing to **{{ REPOSITORIES_CONTRIBUTED_TO }}** public repositories!
